Mapbox for WP Advanced displays rich and beautiful Mapbox maps in your WordPress websites with a lot of powerful features but no coding!

== Description ==

The plugin **Mapbox for WP Advanced** allows you to quickly and easily display rich and beautiful styled maps, tailored to the style of your WordPress website.

**Do you know MapBox ?**
This platform is build on the famous Leaflet library, an Open-Source JavaScript Library for Mobile-Friendly Interactive Maps that has all the features needed for online maps and that works efficiently across all major desktop and mobile platforms. Moreover, Mapbox is powered by open data from OpenStreetMap, the ‘Wikipedia of maps’.


**Mapbox for WP Advanced is very easy to use**
Create your (free) account on [mapbox.com](http://www.mapbox.com "mapbox.com") and start to create your map online with Mapbox Editor: choose the map type, set your customized colors, define your markers on the map, then grab your access token, map ID and you are now ready to integrate your map on your WordPress website!
To go further, build rich and complex maps with [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/#darwin "Mapbox Studio").

The plugin [Mapbox for WP Advanced](http://mapbox-for-wordpress.stephanemartinw.com "Mapbox for WP Advanced plugin") lets you display your mapbox maps in widgets or in your posts with shortcodes. So, you can display as many maps (or as many views of a map) on a page as you want.

Mapbox for WP Advanced does not just display a Mapbox map within a frame (Easy Embed mode) ! The latest version of mapbox.js is linked from Mapbox server and this API is used to develop and implement a lot of great features. 
With the plugin’s default parameters, you do not need to repeat map settings from one map to another. Just override the default parameters according to the specific design of each map you want to display.
